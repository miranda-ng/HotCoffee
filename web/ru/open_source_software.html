                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying Modified Versions.

  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
version:

   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
   this License applicable to that copy.

  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

  4. Combined Works.

  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
the following:

   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
   covered by this License.

   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
   document.

   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.

   d) Do one of the following:

       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
       Corresponding Source.

       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
       Version.

   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
   for conveying Corresponding Source.)

  5. Combined Libraries.

  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side by side in a single library together with other library
facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
choice, if you do both of the following:

   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
   conveyed under the terms of this License.

   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.

         License Mixing with apps, libcurl and Third Party Libraries
         ===========================================================

libcurl can be built to use a fair amount of various third party libraries,
libraries that are written and provided by other parties that are distributed
using their own licenses. Even libcurl itself contains code that may cause
problems to some. This document attempts to describe what licenses libcurl and
the other libraries use and what possible dilemmas linking and mixing them all
can lead to for end users.

I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice!

One common dilemma is that GPL[1]-licensed code is not allowed to be linked
with code licensed under the Original BSD license (with the announcement
clause). You may still build your own copies that use them all, but
distributing them as binaries would be to violate the GPL license - unless you
accompany your license with an exception[2]. This particular problem was
addressed when the Modified BSD license was created, which does not have the
announcement clause that collides with GPL.

libcurl http://curl.haxx.se/docs/copyright.html

        Uses an MIT (or Modified BSD)-style license that is as liberal as
        possible.  Some of the source files that deal with KRB4 have Original
        BSD-style announce-clause licenses. You may not distribute binaries
        with krb4-enabled libcurl that also link with GPL-licensed code!

OpenSSL http://www.openssl.org/source/license.html

        (May be used for SSL/TLS support) Uses an Original BSD-style license
        with an announcement clause that makes it "incompatible" with GPL. You
        are not allowed to ship binaries that link with OpenSSL that includes
        GPL code (unless that specific GPL code includes an exception for
        OpenSSL - a habit that is growing more and more common). If OpenSSL's
        licensing is a problem for you, consider using GnuTLS or yassl
        instead.

GnuTLS  http://www.gnutls.org/

        (May be used for SSL/TLS support) Uses the LGPL[3] license. If this is
        a problem for you, consider using OpenSSL instead. Also note that
        GnuTLS itself depends on and uses other libs (libgcrypt and
        libgpg-error) and they too are LGPL- or GPL-licensed.

yassl   http://www.yassl.com/

        (May be used for SSL/TLS support) Uses the GPL[1] license. If this is
        a problem for you, consider using OpenSSL or GnuTLS instead.

NSS     http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/

        (May be used for SSL/TLS support) Is covered by the MPL[4] license,
        the GPL[1] license and the LGPL[3] license. You may choose to license
        the code under MPL terms, GPL terms, or LGPL terms. These licenses
        grant you different permissions and impose different obligations. You
        should select the license that best meets your needs.

axTLS   http://axtls.sourceforge.net/

        (May be used for SSL/TLS support) Uses a Modified BSD-style license.

c-ares  http://daniel.haxx.se/projects/c-ares/license.html

        (Used for asynchronous name resolves) Uses an MIT license that is very
        liberal and imposes no restrictions on any other library or part you
        may link with.

zlib    http://www.gzip.org/zlib/zlib_license.html

        (Used for compressed Transfer-Encoding support) Uses an MIT-style
        license that shouldn't collide with any other library.

krb4

        While nothing in particular says that a Kerberos4 library must use any
        particular license, the one I've tried and used successfully so far
        (kth-krb4) is partly Original BSD-licensed with the announcement
        clause. Some of the code in libcurl that is written to deal with
        Kerberos4 is Modified BSD-licensed.

MIT Kerberos http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/dist/

        (May be used for GSS support) MIT licensed, that shouldn't collide
        with any other parts.

Heimdal http://www.pdc.kth.se/heimdal/

        (May be used for GSS support) Heimdal is Original BSD licensed with
        the announcement clause.

GNU GSS http://www.gnu.org/software/gss/

        (May be used for GSS support) GNU GSS is GPL licensed. Note that you
        may not distribute binary curl packages that uses this if you build
        curl to also link and use any Original BSD licensed libraries!

fbopenssl

        (Used for SPNEGO support) Unclear license. Based on its name, I assume
        that it uses the OpenSSL license and thus shares the same issues as
        described for OpenSSL above.

libidn  http://josefsson.org/libidn/

        (Used for IDNA support) Uses the GNU Lesser General Public
        License [3]. LGPL is a variation of GPL with slightly less aggressive
        "copyleft". This license requires more requirements to be met when
        distributing binaries, see the license for details. Also note that if
        you distribute a binary that includes this library, you must also
        include the full LGPL license text. Please properly point out what
        parts of the distributed package that the license addresses.

OpenLDAP http://www.openldap.org/software/release/license.html

        (Used for LDAP support) Uses a Modified BSD-style license. Since
        libcurl uses OpenLDAP as a shared library only, I have not heard of
        anyone that ships OpenLDAP linked with libcurl in an app.

libssh2 http://www.libssh2.org/

        (Used for scp and sftp support) libssh2 uses a Modified BSD-style
        license.

PCRE LICENCE
------------

PCRE is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax
and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.

Release 8 of PCRE is distributed under the terms of the "BSD" licence, as
specified below. The documentation for PCRE, supplied in the "doc"
directory, is distributed under the same terms as the software itself.

The basic library functions are written in C and are freestanding. Also
included in the distribution is a set of C++ wrapper functions, and a
just-in-time compiler that can be used to optimize pattern matching. These
are both optional features that can be omitted when the library is built.
